To clone this repository
on command line use git clone git@github.com:RaccoonHowell/whattheplanet.git

Files
Don't make any changes directly to the style.css or style.min.css files as these have been created using gulp tasks (sass and minify-css) so will be updated automatically when the watch task is running and changes are made to the scss files. Only use scss files for updating the styling and keep them in the scss folder. If creating a new scss file, add it to the all.scss file.

Install NPM Packages
On command line type 'npm install' in the project directory and this will install all relevant packages (seen in node modules folder) for the project.

Packages required:
gulp
gulp-clean-css
gulp-concat
gulp-rename
gulp-sass
gulp-uglify-es
browser-sync
